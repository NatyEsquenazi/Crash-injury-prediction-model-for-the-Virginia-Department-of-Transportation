# Crash-injury-prediction-model-for-the-Virginia-Department-of-Transportation
Over the past two decades, the United States have had one of the greatest crash injury rates in the Americas region (Robartes and Chen, 2017). As cities, counties, and departments of transportation invest more resources into road infrastructure, it must be understood what can be done to minimize injuries. Between 2015 and 2023, over 40,000 car crashes with injuries were reported yearly in Virginia. These statistics highlight the importance of understanding the causes behind car crash injuries in Virginia to mitigate the possibility of a higher increase in the future. This research uses supervised machine learning techniques along with car crash data published by the Virginia department of transportation (VDOT) to identify the features that contribute the most to predicting driversâ€™ injuries.

This analysis's contribution is focused on highlighting the importance of evidence in policymaking and opening the floor to informed discussions in road traffic safety management. Through this work, we aim to contribute significantly to the ongoing efforts towards a safer and more resilient transportation system in Virginia and beyond.
